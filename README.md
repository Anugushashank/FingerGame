I have used gridview for creating a N*N matrix.Gridview is filled with buttons.Then a random number is chosen between 0 and n*n,which 
is used for identifying a particular button,is highlighted by toggling a color.I have included only Action_up and Action_down motion 
movements.Alertdialog is used for showing the outcome.
